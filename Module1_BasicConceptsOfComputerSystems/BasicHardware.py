Basic computer hardware
Hardware is the term for the physical parts of a computer. In contrast, 
software is the term for the programs (the 0's and 1's) that instruct 
the computer what to do. A computer's hardware includes:

CPU: Hardware that runs program instructions and controls other 
hardware; called the computer's brain. CPU is short for central 
processing unit. The CPU has two main components:
The arithmetic logic unit or ALU performs arithmetic (+, -, *, /) and 
logic (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) operations on binary integers.
The control unit tells computer components, such as memory, the ALU, 
and input and output devices, how to respond to computer instructions.
Memory: Hardware that stores data. Memory is also called RAM, short 
for Random Access Memory.
Keyboard: Hardware for input that allows a user to type characters.
Screen: Hardware for output that displays characters and images to a user.

Cache, memory, drive
Drive and memory
A computer's memory (RAM) holds data temporarily; when electricity is turned off, 
all data is lost. A computer's drive stores data even after electricity is 
turned off. Thus, items like programs, documents, photos, and videos are 
stored on the drive.

Accessing a drive is slower than accessing memory. Thus, when a 
CPU runs a program, the CPU first copies the program and other 
needed data into memory, and runs the program from memory. 
Memory is expensive and thus smaller than drive, so might only f
it a part of the program and data.
