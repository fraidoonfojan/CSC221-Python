Grouping related items into objects
The physical world is made up of material items such as 
wood, metal, plastic, fabric, etc. To keep the world understandable, 
people think in terms of higher-level objects, like chairs, tables, and TVs. 
Those objects are groupings of the lower-level items.

Likewise, a program is made up of lower-level items like variables and functions. 
To keep programs understandable, programmers often deal with 
higher-level groupings of those items, known as objects. 
In programming, an object is a grouping of data (variables) 
and operations that can be performed on that data (functions or methods).
