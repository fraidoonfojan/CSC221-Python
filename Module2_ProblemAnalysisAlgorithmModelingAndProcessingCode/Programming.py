Programming (general)
Computer program basics
Computer programs are abundant in many people's lives today, carrying out 
applications on smartphones, tablets, and laptops, powering businesses 
like Amazon and Netflix, helping cars drive and planes fly, and much more.

A computer program consists of instructions executing one at a time. 
Basic instruction types are:

Input: A program gets data, perhaps from a file, keyboard, 
touchscreen, network, etc.
Process: A program performs computations on that data, such as 
adding two values like x + y.
Output: A program puts that data somewhere, such as to a file, screen, 
network, etc.
Programs use variables to refer to data, like x, y, and z below. 
The name is due to a variable's value "varying" as a program assigns 
a variable like x with new values.


A basic computer program's instructions get input, process, and put output. 
This program first assigns x with what is typed on the keyboard input, 
in this case 2.
The program's next instruction gets the next input, in this case 5.
The program then does some processing, in this case 
assigning z with x + y (so 2 + 5 yields 7).
Finally, the program puts z (7) to output, in this case to a screen.

A program is like a recipe
Some people think of a program as being like a cooking recipe. 
A recipe consists of instructions that a chef executes, 
like adding eggs or stirring ingredients. Likewise, 
a computer program consists of instructions that 
a computer executes, like multiplying numbers or 
outputting a number to a screen.

Computational thinking
Mathematical thinking became increasingly important throughout the 
industrial age, to enable people to successfully live and work. 
In the information age, many people believe computational thinking, 
or creating a sequence of instructions to solve a problem, will 
become increasingly important for work and everyday life. 
A sequence of instructions that solves a problem is called an algorithm.

 Algorithms
Problem solving and algorithms
Programs solve problems. Before writing a program, a programmer must first 
create an algorithm to correctly solve the given problem. An algorithm 
is a sequence of steps that solves a problem, generating correct output 
for any valid input values. Ensuring an algorithm's correctness is a key 
job for a programmer.

Introduction to algorithms
Algorithms
An algorithm describes a sequence of steps to solve a computational 
problem or perform a calculation. An algorithm can be described 
in English, pseudocode, a programming language, hardware, etc. 
A computational problem specifies an input, a question about the 
input that can be answered using a computer, and the desired output.

Practical applications of algorithms
Computational problems can be found in numerous domains, including e-commerce, internet technologies, biology, manufacturing, transportation, etc. Algorithms have been developed for numerous computational problems within these domains.

A computational problem can be solved in many ways, but finding the best 
algorithm to solve a problem can be challenging. However, many computational 
problems have common subproblems, for which efficient algorithms have been 
developed. The examples below describe a computational problem within a 
specific domain and list a common algorithm (each discussed elsewhere) 
that can be used to solve the problem.

Algorithm efficiency
Introduction to algorithm efficiency
Algorithms differ in various features. One feature is algorithm time efficiency: 
The number of calculations required to solve a problem. For the same 
problem, some algorithms may be much more time efficient than others.

Simple programs are more likely to be correct, and correctness is always 
most important. Efficient algorithms tend to be less simple, so programmers 
should consider efficiency only when needed, like when dealing with 
very large data sets that result in slow program
