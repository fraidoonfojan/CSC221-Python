print('Enter wage:', end=' ')
wage = int(input())


new_wage = wage + 10
print('New wage:', new_wage)


#input() reads an input value '8' from the keyboard as a new string.
#int() converts '8' from a string to an integer type, and the integer is stored as the variable wage.
#The integer value of wage can then be used to perform a calculation, like adding 10 to create a new variable new_wage.

#Question
# The first line of code provided in the code window reads an integer value from input into user_num1.
# The second line of code provided in the code window reads an integer value from input into user_num2.
#
# Complete the program as follows:
# Write a line of code that reads an integer value from input into user_num3.
# Write a print() statement that outputs the product of user_num1, user_num2, user_num3.
# Note:
# The product is user_num1 * user_num2 * user_num3.

user_num1 = int(input()) # Reads user_num1 from input
user_num2 = int(input()) # Reads user_num2 from input

''' Your solution goes here '''
user_num3 = int(input())
print(user_num1*user_num2* user_num3)
